# AppointmentScheduler
Appointment Scheduler is a application which allows user ot login with username and password, then he/she can book appointment with the other person present in teh database.
1. Initially, This was a cosnole based application. I was taking a backup data of some users. User can login with their Username and password. If the user was logged In, He/ She can book appointment with the guest User/Other users in the application.   
2. Then, we used Entity Framework to create the database tables from the model class.
3. Now, I have changed it into Web application  currently my application shows all the appointments from teh database.
